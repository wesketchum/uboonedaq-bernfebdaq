# The "include_directories()" macro below is not strictly necessary
# from an artdaq-demo perspective, but if users of other packages wish
# to implement their own BuildInfo-style modules they can copy this
# CMakeLists.txt file and easily use "include_directories()" to set
# their include path(s)

# PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR contains the full path to the root of your
# project source directory, i.e. to the nearest directory where
# CMakeLists.txt contains the PROJECT() command

# Uncomment the MESSAGE() macro to actually see what
# PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR is set to during the build

# MESSAGE( STATUS "PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR:         " ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} )

include_directories( ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} )

# the utcDateTime variable is used by the GetPackageBuildInfo code
# to report the build datetime
execute_process( COMMAND "date" "-u" "+%d-%b-%Y %H:%M:%S %Z" OUTPUT_VARIABLE rawUTCDate )
