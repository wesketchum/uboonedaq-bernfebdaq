# "nADCcounts" is the number of ADC values produced per fragment per
#  event by the ToySimulator module

# This value should be an even number

nADCcounts: 40

# "throttle_usecs" is the pause, in microseconds, before a new event
#  is generated. Useful for preventing upstream event generation from
#  overwhelming downstream event processing.

throttle_usecs: 100000
