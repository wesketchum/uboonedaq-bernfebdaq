Usage: ${scriptName} [options] <command>
Where command is one of:
  init, start, pause, resume, stop, status, get-legal-commands,
  shutdown, start-system, restart, reinit, exit,
  fast-shutdown, fast-restart, fast-reinit, or fast-exit
General options:
  -h, --help: prints this usage message
  -C: Configuration file to pass to DemoControl (required)
Configuration options (init commands):
  -M <onmon dir>: Where to store onmon output file (if enabled in config)
Begin-run options (start command):
  -N <run number>: specifies the run number
Notes:
  The start command expects a run number to be specified (-N).
  The primary commands are the following:
   * init - initializes (configures) the DAQ processes
   * start - starts a run
   * pause - pauses the run
   * resume - resumes the run
   * stop - stops the run
   * status - checks the status of each DAQ process
   * get-legal-commands - fetches the legal commands from each DAQ process
  Additional commands include:
   * shutdown - stops the run (if one is going), resets the DAQ processes
       to their ground state (if needed), and stops the MPI program (DAQ processes)
   * start-system - starts the MPI program (the DAQ processes)
   * restart - this is the same as a shutdown followed by a start-system
   * reinit - this is the same as a shutdown followed by a start-system and an init
   * exit - this resets the DAQ processes to their ground state, stops the MPI
       program, and exits PMT.
  Expert-level commands:
   * fast-shutdown - stops the MPI program (all DAQ processes) no matter what
       state they are in. This could have bad consequences if a run is going!
   * fast-restart - this is the same as a fast-shutdown followed by a start-system
   * fast-reinit - this is the same as a fast-shutdown followed by a start-system
       and an init
   * fast-exit - this stops the MPI program, and exits PMT.
Examples: ${scriptName} init
          ${scriptName} -N 101 start
