ASCII Simulator Example

This example uses the AsciiSimulator_generator class to generate files which contain ASCII
 strings. The AsciiSimulator may be configured to dump data from the generator to a file, 
which can then be compared with the output of the asciiDump ART module. This serves as a 
proof of ARTDAQ's data-handling safety, as the output root file can be analyzed and the 
original raw bitstream reproduced.
